# Kickstarter-Projects-State-Prediction---Machine-Learning-Project
Kickstarter is an online crowdfunding platform aimed at helping people get their ideas funded while building a community of fans to support their ideas. While Kickstarter publishes much advice and best practices on its blog, over half of the campaigns still fail. 

Why does this matter? Well, unlike their competitor, Indiegogo, Kickstarter campaign projects follow an "all or nothing" funding model. This means that if a Kickstarter campaign fails, both the project creators and the people who contributed are disappointed, as the project will not be completed in any capacity. 

Here is some data available from the Kickstarter website. However, due to the dataset being too large to upload, here I only upload the first 1000 lines of the entire dataset.

## Problem Statement 
Create a model that enables Kickstarter to predict the target variable state, given all the other variables.
